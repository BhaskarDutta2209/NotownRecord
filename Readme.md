#Note
- The database has to be set in the local machine. I am still not sure how to export the dB
- This is a very basic implementation without frontend or application. It is a simple terminal application. Incase you want a GUI, you may have to do it yourself

#Setup steps
- Create the db in your local machine
- In the driver class put the exposed port by your database along with your username and password
- Make necessary changes in name of the field if you have had a different db
- Run the main method in the driver class
